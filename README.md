## Design and Layout 

This fashion blog is powered by Django, a high-level Python web framework known for its rapid development and versatility. Django allows me to create a dynamic and feature-rich blog, making it the perfect choice for showcasing fashion trends and managing my content. I used Visual Studio Code for my IDE, and for the database, I used SQLite. 

## Front-End Development

This fashion blog implements both JavaScript and HTML for the user interface. 

## Back-End Development 

### Django 
- Developed a user registration and authentication systems to allow users to create accounts and log in
- Implemented a content management system (CMS) to manage blog posts, categories, and tags
- Developed an admin panel for you to manage the blog's content easily
- Set up routing and URL handling to link front-end pages to back-end functionality
